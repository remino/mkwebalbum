## Usage

```
mkwebalbum 1.3.0

USAGE: mkwebalbum [<options>] [<inputdir>] [<outputfile>]

Generate album Web page with previews from a directory of photos.

Only the top-level directory is processed and only the image files are listed
by default. Dot files and directories are ignored. If <inputdir> is not given,
the current directory is used.

Outputs to index.html by default unless specified otherwise. Can also output to
stdout if <outputfile> is specified as '-'.

Requires awk and imagemagick.

OPTIONS:

	-a          List all files and sub-directions.
	-e <regex>  Exclude files with name matching this regex.
	            Defaults to '^\.'.
	-h          Show this help screen.
	-r          Regenerate previews instead of skipping those that already exist.
	-t <title>  Specify HTML title. Defaults to name of <inputdir>.
	-v          Show script name and version number.
